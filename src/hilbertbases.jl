    compatibility_basis(sgnum::Integer, D::Integer=3; kwargs...)

Computes the Hilbert basis associated with a Smith normal form `F` of the EBR matrix or from
a space group number `sgnum`, which respects all compatibility relations, returning a
`SymBasis` structure. The returned basis is a non-negative integer coefficient basis
for all possible band structures {BS}.

If the method is called with `sgnum::Integer`, the underlying `BandRepSet` is also returned.

## Keyword arguments

- `algorithm::String`: controls the algorithm used by Normaliz to compute the Hilbert
basis. Choices are `"DualMode"` (default) and `"PrimalMode"`
- `spinful::Bool`: Use single- (`false`, default) or double-valued (`true`) irreps.
- `timereversal::Bool`: Assume presence (`true`, default) or absence (`false`) of
time-reversal symmetry.
- `verbose::Bool`: whether to print progress info during the Normaliz computation
(`false`, default).

# Footnotes:
# ¹⁾ We want to control the algorithm used to calculate the Hilbert basis in Normaliz: I've
# found that Normaliz usually picks the "PrimalMode" algorithm (not always though), despite
# the documentation stating that "DualMode" usually is better for cones defined by
# inequalities. Through tests, I've found that there is usually a speedup of order 2-10,
# if the "DualMode" algorithm is picked instead; occassionally, up to ×100s. The speedup 
# seems to be especially large for the systems that are (very) hard to solve (e.g. 131). 
# To force "DualMode", we use the method `C.Compute(<quantity-to-compute>, <algorithm>)`, 
# which then calculates `<quantity-to-compute>` and stores it in `C` (here, "HilbertBasis");
# it can then subsequently be retrieved from `C` with `C.HilbertBasis()`.
# Some situations remain effectively out of reach still: for bosons without time-reversal
# symmetry, there are a handful of SGs for which nontopological_basis(..) does not seem to
# terminate in a reasonable amount of time (15h+ tested).
